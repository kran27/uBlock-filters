# uBlock-filters

My personal set of ublock filters, mostly to hide AI integrations, short-form content, site-specific advertisements for "premium" subscriptions, or just parts of sites I don't interact with, to make the things I do use easier to find.

These are simply what I myself use, I don't plan to provide any form of support for removing or adding your own blocks if your preferences differ.
